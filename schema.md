Using this formula the Generative AI, must be able to tell the expected duration for the studying plan

This input is made based on the student answers to the form and also to the total topics to be covered based on the syllabus content available.

- Total Topics Across SubjectsÂ =Â [The total of lessons based on the syllabus, with consideration to the chapters for logical hierrarchial order].
- Study Days Per WeekÂ =Â 5 [fixed]
- Hours Per WeekÂ =Â [depending on studentsâ€™s pace: accelerated (5) * 7, standard(3) * 7, relaxed (1) * 7]
- Average Time Per TopicÂ =Â 3 hours [fixed]

### **How AI Adapts the Plan Dynamically**

Adjustiments to pace, will affects hours per week and will result on recalculation of the studying plan from where the user is at currently.

**Faster Pace?**Â â†’ AI increases the number of topics covered per week.

**Slower Pace?**Â â†’ AI reduces the number of topics per week.

**Extending duration?**Â â†’ AI assigns more time per topic, increasing duration.
