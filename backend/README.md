# Darajat Hack Project Documentation

## Overview

The **Darajat Hack Project** is an educational platform designed to help students create personalized study plans based on their academic history, available study time, and the subjects they need to cover. The project leverages Generative AI to dynamically adjust study plans, provide daily study content, and offer coaching based on the student's progress. The platform is built using a backend powered by **Express.js** and **Bun**, with AI capabilities provided by **Google's Gemini** model via **LangChain**.

---

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key components:

### 1. **Backend**
   - Built with **Express.js** and **Bun**.
   - Provides RESTful APIs for creating study plans, generating daily content, and offering coaching.
   - Uses **Helmet** for security and **CORS** for cross-origin requests.

### 2. **AI Integration**
   - Utilizes **Google's Gemini** model via **LangChain** for generating study plans, content, and coaching responses.
   - The AI dynamically adjusts study plans based on the student's pace and progress.

### 3. **Syllabus Management**
   - Contains structured syllabus data for grades 10, 11, and 12 in JSON format.
   - The AI uses this syllabus to create study plans tailored to the student's academic level.

### 4. **Content Generation**
   - Generates daily study content, including reading materials, videos, and quizzes.
   - The content is dynamically created based on the student's current study plan.

### 5. **Coaching**
   - Provides AI-driven coaching to answer student questions based on the context of their study material.

## Key Features

### 1. **Study Plan Creation**
   - Students input their available study hours, last completed academic year, and years missed.
   - The AI generates a personalized study plan covering the necessary subjects and topics.

### 2. **Dynamic Study Plan Adjustment**
   - The AI adjusts the study plan based on the student's pace:
     - **Faster Pace**: Increases the number of topics covered per week.
     - **Slower Pace**: Reduces the number of topics per week.
     - **Extended Duration**: Assigns more time per topic.

### 3. **Daily Study Content**
   - The AI generates daily study content, including:
     - **Reading Materials**: Summarized content for each topic.
     - **Videos**: Relevant YouTube videos for visual learning.
     - **Quizzes**: Multiple-choice questions to test understanding.

### 4. **AI Coaching**
   - Students can ask questions related to their study material.
   - The AI provides detailed answers based on the context of the material.
